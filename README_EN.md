## üöÄ Quick Start

### Requirements

- Latest version of ComfyUI
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA support (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/CHAOSEA/comfyui_facecorrector.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd comfyui_facecorrector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Restart ComfyUI

### First Use Notes

- Required models will be downloaded automatically on first run
- Model files will be saved in the corresponding `ComfyUI/models/` directory
- Ensure internet connectivity for model downloads

### Required Models

This node requires the following model files:

1. YOLO Face Detection Model:
   - Path: `ComfyUI/models/ultralytics/bbox/face_yolov8m.pt`
   - Purpose: Fast and accurate face detection

2. InsightFace Model:
   - Path: `ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l`
   - Purpose: Face analysis and landmark detection

3. BiSeNet Model:
   - Path: `ComfyUI/models/bisenet/resnet34.onnx`
   - Purpose: Precise face segmentation mask generation

These models will be downloaded automatically on first run. If download fails, please refer to the [Model Download Guide](docs/model_download_guide.md) for manual download.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### FaceCorrector Node

- **Input Parameters**:
  - `image`: Image to process
  - `detection_method`: Face detection method (insightface, yolo)
  - `crop_size`: Output image size
  - `face_ratio`: Face height ratio in image (0.5-1.3)
  - `align_mode`: Alignment mode (arcface)
  - `mask_type`: Mask type (jonathandinu, bisenet, none)
  - `auto_rotate`: Enable automatic rotation (yes, no)

- **Outputs**:
  - `aligned_face`: Aligned face image
  - `face_mask`: Face mask
  - `warp_matrix`: Transformation matrix

### FacePaster Node

- **Input Parameters**:
  - `image`: Original image
  - `corrected_face`: Modified face image
  - `face_mask`: Face mask for smooth blending
  - `use_mask`: Use mask (yes, no)
  - `warp_matrix`: (Optional) Transformation matrix from FaceCorrector

- **Output**:
  - `image`: Final composited image

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Auto Rotation Feature

The auto-rotation feature intelligently handles faces at various abnormal angles:

1. **Face Pose Estimation**: Precisely estimates face roll, yaw, and pitch angles through facial landmark analysis
2. **Smart Rotation Decision**: Determines rotation necessity and angle based on pose estimation
3. **High-Quality Rotation**: Uses Lanczos interpolation for high-quality image rotation, preserving details
4. **Correction Validation**: Re-detects face and evaluates pose post-rotation, applying changes only if pose improves

### Use Cases

- **Inverted Faces**: Handles 180-degree inverted faces from upside-down photos
- **Significant Tilt**: Corrects faces with noticeable roll tilt (over 10 degrees)
- **Extreme Side View**: Adjusts severely side-facing faces (around 90 degrees)
- **Special Cases**: Accurately estimates and corrects pose even with partial occlusion or closed eyes

### face_ratio Parameter

The `face_ratio` parameter controls face proportion in the output image, ranging from 0.5 to 1.3:
- Higher values make the face appear larger (closer)
- Lower values make the face appear smaller (farther)

## üìã FAQ

1. **Q: What if model download fails?**
   A: You can manually download model files and place them in the corresponding directory. See [Model Download Guide](docs/model_download_guide.md)

2. **Q: Is batch processing supported?**
   A: Currently supports batch input, but processes internally one by one.
